## Hi 🐱

A brief bio (in _Markdown_) for fun.

I'm currently working on random things (mainly in Golang). Before Golang, I'm done some work in JavaScript/Java/Python as well.

Though my career focuses a lot on products, I find systems insightful as well. Always excited to learn new things (gradually 📈).
